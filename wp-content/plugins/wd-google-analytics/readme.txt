The following options are available among Tracking Settings:

Anonymize IP address. If this option is enabled, the last digits of users’ IP addresses will be hidden. Their full IP will not be visible, and thus the visitors will be anonymized.

Enhanced Link Attribution. Turn on this option to track multiple links with the same destination. Get information for buttons, menus, as well as elements with multiple destinations, e.g. search boxes. More information about Enhanced Link Attribution can be found here.

Logged in
Post type
Author

Click on Add button next to each custom dimension to start its tracking. Custom dimensions tracking can be enabled or disabled with these options any time.

Custom Dimensions

As the default dimensions provided by Google Analytics, there can also be Custom Dimensions, which you can configure yourself. They can be handy when you want to analyze specific data, which Google Analytics does not track automatically. 

Google Analytics WD plugin provides six options for your WordPress sites, that can be used for creating Custom Dimensions.

For example, when you enable Logged in custom dimension, you can get tracking report particularly based on users, who are logged in to your website.

Furthermore, you can see the traffic of your website posts based on Post Types, Authors, Categories, Published at and Tags.

Using these custom dimensions you can check which one of your post authors is the favorite of your website visitors, for instance, or which category posts are read the most.


Exclude

You can set exclusions by user types and certain users with Exclude tracking by role and Exclude tracking for user. Select the user types and users, the activity of which you would like to exclude from Google Analytics tracking. Any interactions from these users will be ignored when evaluating reports.

Note, that these exclusions are set locally on your website, unlike Filters, which are connected to Google Analytics. In case these tracking exclusions are set and Google Analytics WD plugin detects the specified user or role, it does not include tracking script.

Whereas filters are added to your Google Analytics account, and traffic is excluded based on configurations described in Filters section.

Goal Management

Goals in Google Analytics lets you track targeted activities, which users complete on your website. A completed activity is called conversion. You can set visiting a certain page as a goal, for example, or have users stay on your website a certain period of time. Other examples of goals can be checkout for a shopping site, and setting a certain number of pageviews per session.

You can set and manage goals for your website tracking in Google Analytics WD > Goal Management page. Note, that Goals configured with Google Analytics WD are set only to the domain on which the plugin is installed.

Select the View that you’re going to track and configure the following options based on the type of goal you would like to set:

Provide a Name for the goal and choose its Type from one of the following:

Destination. Set a specific URL for the goal, for example, your ecommerce website shop page. When a user visits it, it will be counted as a goal conversion. You can set the destination using one of these conditions:
Equals to. Should be the exact URL of the page you are using to set the goal.
Begins with. Mentions the beginning of the tracked page link.
Regular expression. This option will search all the visited links with the specified Regular Expression. E.g., if you set it to \btest\b, and users visit URLs which contain “test”, this will be considered as a conversion.

Duration. Determine the time period, during which you need users to stay on your website to complete the goal. Goals of this type are controlled with less than and greater than conditions.

Pages/Screens per session. Choose the number of page/screen views per session, and set the goal using less than and greater than conditions.


Custom Reports

Besides the built-in report types, Google Analytics WD plugin also provides the functionality to configure Custom Reports and view related statistics within Reports page. 

Start with providing a Name for your Custom Report. Then select a Metric and Dimension, based on which the statistics will be built.

For example, you can select Organic Searches as the metric and Keyword as the dimension. This custom setup will let you have a report based on the keywords, which visitors use to find your website with search engines.

You can view and manage created Custom Reports on the same page. The list will appear with a table under options of Custom Reports.
